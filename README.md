The first version of my personal website built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript (Please bear with me on the design)\

# Lessons Learned
After working on this I learned a lot about CSS and what goes into building out a website. I realized that designing a website is very difficult and a lot of time went into thinking about what the layout of the website would look like. Even though I call this my "first version" there was actually 3 different versions (including this one) of this website and it went through a lot of design changes. Overall, I learned a lot about CSS grid, flexbox, animations, units, and media queries.  I also learned a lot about the different interactive enhancements and styling you can add to websites using JavaScript.
