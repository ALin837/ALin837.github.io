# ALin837.github.io
The first version of my personal website built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript \
https://alin837.github.io/

# Lessons Learned
After working on this I learned a lot about CSS and what goes into building out a website. I realized that designing a website is very difficult and a lot of time went into thinking about what the layout of the website would look like (I tried my best). I learned alot about CSS grid, flexbox, animations, units, and media queries.  I also learned a lot about the different interactive enhancements and styling you can add to websites using JavaScript. 

# References
I used Font Awesome for all of my icons so I would like to reference Font Awesome and their awesome icons.\

I also used Haikei to generate the scatter circle background. Haikei is a very useful web app that can be used to generate SVG shapes, backgrounds and patterns.\
