# ALin837.github.io
The first version of my personal website built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript \
https://alin837.github.io/

# Lessons Learned
After working on this I learned a lot about CSS and what goes into building out a website. I realized that designing a website is a lot harder than people might think and a lot of time went into thinking about what the layout of the website would look like.  I learned alot about CSS grid, flexbox, animations, units, and media queries.  I also learned a lot about the different interative enhancements you can add to websites using JavaScript.
